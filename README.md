## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. Our challenges are perfect portfolio pieces, so please feel free to use what you create in your portfolio to show others.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**This project is a collaboration between Frontend Mentor, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. (https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel).**

I had a little help with the css from Kevin.

## The goal of the project
Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
